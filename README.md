Espresshots is an iOS app that allows you to log & track your caffeine intake.

The app allows users to quickly log 1 to 4 shots (majority of cases) using a—customisable—caffeine amount per shot (75mg). It also provides a scale where users can add exactly the amount of caffeine they had.

It uses HealthKit as the caffeine data store, allowing the app to read entries added by other HealthKit-compatible apps.
